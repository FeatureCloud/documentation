# FeatureCloud Documentation

## What is FeatureCloud?

FeatureCloud is a platform for federated applications. Its primary goal is to simplify the development and usage of 
federated machine learning algorithms.

This involves three major areas:
1) Development of apps (creating new federated algorithms and methods)
2) Distribution of apps (providing federated applications to end-users)
3) Usage of apps (using implemented applications as an end-user)

Please also have a look at our website, https://featurecloud.ai, where you find additional information.
