# Installation

This guide helps you set up the FeatureCloud controller.

## Requirements

You need to have Docker installed (at lease version 19). You can get it at https://docker.com.
It is available for Windows, Linux and macOS and has been tested on Windows 10, Ubuntu 20.04 and macOS 10.15 and 11.

In order to execute an app from the AI store, you also need to create an account on https://featurecloud.ai.

## Start the controller

You need to run the startup script, which can be downloaded from the 'Getting Started' page on the main website:
https://featurecloud.ai/getting-started

Then, you need to run it using either `sh` (Linux/macOS) or `cmd.exe` (Windows).

## Test the controller

After logging in on the main website, first activate developer tools in your user profile.
Then, create a site (which represents a physical location hosting data).
After that, you should be able to go to https://featurecloud.ai/controller and verify that the controller is running.

## Running a workflow

To run a workflow, you need to add an app to your personal library and create a project.
